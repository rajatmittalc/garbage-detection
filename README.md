# garbage-detection

Here I am detecting different  materials from trash bins etc so that recycelable materials could be extracted from them. Using this model we can tell weather we should segeregate the heap of waste or not.
It is accurately able to detect the recyclable materials which we can see with rectangular boxes around them which be easily extracted without going for whole lot.
I am using tranfer learning approach to detect recyclable materials from garbage along with some collected images of waste i want to detect.
Modle is completely ready and i earlier had deployed it on falsk but it is not working now, so i would request if anyone wishwes to work on this project please don't directly copy it model is completely ready only flask part need to be redone. thanks
